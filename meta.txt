- Learned a bit about indents and hanging indents, and not putting arguments in the first line, in case of overflowing lines

Function creation checklist:
- Did the function definition start with def?
- Does the function name only have characters and underscores?
- Is there an open paranthesis right after the function name?
- Are there arguments with type definitions (optional) in the parantheses
- Are there commas separating the arguments?
- Is each argument unique?
- Was the paranthesis closed after the arguments were put in?
- Was a colon put at the end of the line to mark end of line?
- Is all of the function's code indented?
- Was code de-dented at the end of the function?

Function execution checklist:
- Was the function run by typing its name?
- Were the round paranteses used?
- Was a set of arguments supplied?
- Were these arguments separated by commas?

There are probably going to be a lot of opinions around the right way to do this. That's okay, as long as there is one consistent way in which you start, and don't let it stop your work.
